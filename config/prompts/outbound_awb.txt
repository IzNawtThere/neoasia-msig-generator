You are analyzing an Air Waybill document for an outbound shipment from NeoAsia (Singapore).

TASK: Extract shipping information from this Air Waybill with PRECISION.

KEY FIELDS TO EXTRACT:
- Master Air Waybill number (typically: XXX-XXXX XXXX or XXX-XXXXXXXX format)
- Flight number (e.g., VN654, SQ914) from "Requested Flight/Date" field
- Shipment date from "Executed on (date)" field - THIS IS THE PRIMARY DATE
- Destination (airport code or city/country, look in "Airport of Destination" field)
- Invoice reference (ITR/SOM number - look in "INVOICE NO:" field or handling info)
- Goods description (VERBATIM from "Nature and Quantity of Goods" section)
- Currency (look in "Currency" field, e.g., SGD, USD, PHP)

CRITICAL DATE EXTRACTION RULES:
DATE PRIORITY (use in this order):
1. FIRST PRIORITY: "Executed on (date)" field at bottom of AWB - format: "15/Sep/2025" or "24/Sep/2025"
   * This is when the shipment was actually processed/executed
   * Example: "Executed on (date): 15/Sep/2025" → flight_date = "2025-09-15"
2. SECOND PRIORITY: Date component in "Requested Flight/Date" field (e.g., "VN654 25SEP" → 25 Sep)
   * Only use this if "Executed on" date is not available

CRITICAL FLIGHT NUMBER EXTRACTION:
- Look for "Requested Flight/Date" field - format shows: "VN654 15SEP" or "SQ914/09-Sep"
- Flight number pattern: 2 LETTERS + 3-4 DIGITS (VN654, SQ914, TK1314)
- Extract the flight code ONLY (e.g., "VN654" from "VN654 15SEP")
- Common carriers: VN (Vietnam Airlines), SQ (Singapore Airlines), TK (Turkish), BR (EVA Air)

CRITICAL DESCRIPTION EXTRACTION:
- Look in "Nature and Quantity of Goods" column on the right side
- Extract VERBATIM - preserve exact wording including "&" and multi-category listings
- Examples:
  * "SKINCARE PRODUCTS & ORAL SUPPLEMENTS" → description = "SKINCARE PRODUCTS & ORAL SUPPLEMENTS"
  * "SKINCARE PRODUCTS" → description = "SKINCARE PRODUCTS"
  * "MEDICAL DEVICES" → description = "MEDICAL DEVICES"

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "awb_number": "extracted AWB number (XXX-XXXXXXXX format) or null",
    "flight_number": "flight code only (e.g., VN654, SQ914) or null",
    "flight_date": "YYYY-MM-DD format from 'Executed on' date or null",
    "destination": "city, country or airport code or null",
    "invoice_reference": "ITR/SOM number if visible or null",
    "description": "EXACT goods description text or null",
    "currency": "currency code (SGD, USD, PHP, etc.) or null",
    "confidence": "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW",
    "notes": "any observations about extraction"
}

RULES:
1. Return null for fields you cannot find with certainty
2. Flight format is 2 letters + 3-4 digits (SQ914, VN654, TK1314)
3. AWB format is XXX-XXXXXXXX (e.g., 618-45448056) or 738 SIN XXXX XXXX
4. Date conversion: "15/Sep/2025" → "2025-09-15", "24/Sep/2025" → "2025-09-24"
5. Preserve description text EXACTLY as written (including &, /, etc.)
6. Respond with valid JSON only - no additional text

ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):
- NEVER invent or fabricate: dates, flight numbers, AWB numbers, descriptions
- If a field is not clearly visible, use null - silence is preferred over incorrect certainty
- Do NOT carry over values from other documents or prior context
- Each document must be processed independently based on what is visible
- If document is blurry or partially visible, set confidence to LOW and leave uncertain fields null
- Do NOT guess flight numbers based on airline patterns - extract only what is explicitly shown
- Do NOT auto-complete partial values
