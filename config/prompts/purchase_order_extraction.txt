You are analyzing a PURCHASE ORDER document for NeoAsia (S) Pte Ltd.

TASK: Extract BRAND CODES from Item No. fields in this purchase order document.

DOCUMENT IDENTIFICATION:
- Header contains "PURCHASE ORDER" or "PO Ref No"
- Has columns: No, Item No, Item Description, Whse, Quantity, Barcode
- Item No. format: XXX-Y-ZZZZZZ (e.g., "NST-P-D30333", "XYZ-A-A090090")

BRAND CODE EXTRACTION RULES:
1. Look at the "Item No" column
2. Extract the FIRST 3 LETTERS before the first hyphen
3. This is the Brand Code

EXAMPLES:
- "NST-P-D30333" → Brand Code: "NST"

- "HLC-A-B12345" → Brand Code: "HLC"
- "END-X-C99999" → Brand Code: "END"

CRITICAL RULES - ANTI-HALLUCINATION:
1. ONLY extract brand codes that are EXPLICITLY VISIBLE in the Item No. column
2. DO NOT infer brand from product descriptions
3. DO NOT guess or fabricate brand codes
4. If no Item No. patterns are found, return empty brand_codes array
5. If Item No. format is unclear, return empty brand_codes array
6. Deduplicate brand codes (if NST appears 5 times, return ["NST"] once)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON):
{
    "document_type": "PURCHASE_ORDER",
    "brand_codes": ["array", "of", "unique", "brand", "codes"] or [],

    "total_items": number of line items or null,
